# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ";ty"
    replace: "Thank you,\nTommy"

  - trigger: ";shrug"
    replace: "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

  - trigger: "yuor"
    replace: "your"

  - trigger: "yuo"
    replace: "you"

  - trigger: ";github"
    replace: "https://github.com/djfriar"

  - trigger: ";linkedin"
    replace: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommycraft/"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ";date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ";shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
